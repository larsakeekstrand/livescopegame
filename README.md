# LiveScope Fishing Game

A React-based fishing game that simulates a LiveScope (down-scan) fishing experience. Control a lure to catch fish in a virtual underwater environment.

## Game Features

- Realistic LiveScope underwater visualization with a detailed bottom terrain
- Fish that swim naturally through the water
- Player-controlled lure that can be moved using arrow keys
- Ability to catch fish when the lure comes close to them
- Reel in caught fish using the spacebar
- Score tracking based on the size of fish caught

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (←, →, ↑, ↓) to move your lure around in the water
2. Position your lure close to a fish to catch it
3. Once a fish is caught, press the spacebar to reel it in
4. Successfully reeling in a fish will add to your score based on the fish's size
5. Try to catch as many fish as possible to achieve a high score!

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move the lure
- **Spacebar**: Reel in a caught fish

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Running the Game

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for Production

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Future Enhancements
